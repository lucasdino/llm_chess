This move leads to a catastrophic loss of material (-9514 cp) primarily because it allows White to execute a series of advantageous exchanges starting with capturing a valuable piece on e2, exploiting potential weaknesses created by misaligning the black rook. Such a large disadvantage usually signifies a strategic or tactical oversight that's costly. In general, moving a defensive piece away from a key area without addressing more pressing threats often results in negative outcomes. Therefore, alternative moves preserving coordination and defending crucial squares simultaneously would offer better prospects."]]}
